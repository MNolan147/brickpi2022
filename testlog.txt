11/04/2022 11:39:33 AM: 
    Issue: turns not exact degrees
    Fix: adjust margin of error
    Result: Turns are exact

11/04/2022 11:41:45 AM:
    Issue: ZeroDevisionError raised when calculating x value
    Notes: logs suggest that the error occurs when iterating over an empty array 
    Fix: ignore ampty arrays
    Result: works for most cases but, fails when xpoints is empty and ypoints is zero

11/04/2022 11:54:12 AM:
    Issue: result of previous
    Notes: this likely occurs as the funtion doesn't account for no change in x
    Fix: bypass calculation if robot x and point x are the same by retuning that value
    Result: succsessfully completes function

11/04/2022 12:20:12 PM:
    Issue: minimal walls are discovered at the end of the scan
    Notes: This is perhaps an issue with the environment
    Fix: test in a location with exact flat walls
    Result: behaviour continued

11/04/2022 12:32:56 PM:
    Issue: walls failed to be discovered
    Notes: By inspecting the logs it was found that the grid was being generated incorrectly
    Fix: grid generates points on regular grid. adjust other code to comply with changes
    Result: Behaviour contiued

11/04/2022 1:19:45 PM:
    Issue: walls failed to be discovered
    Notes: logs showed that walls were being duplicated on generation (i.e., there were 2 walls at point (0.5,0))
    Fix: tweak map generator to store walls and to store them when a duplicate comes up rather than generate new walls
    Result: Behaviour contiued

13/04/2022 11:30:00 AM:
    Issue: walls failed to be discovered
    Notes: N/A
    Fix: try in official maze
    Result: walls successfully detected
